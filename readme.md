### ü§ì A "little" about me ...

I've always been curious and wanted to understand how the world around me works ...

When I was around 10, I got my first computer and spent a lot of my free time
playing computer games, initially just single player or LAN games with friends.
But eventually I stumbled upon MMOs and had my first experiences with hackers.
Instead of getting frustrated about not being able to compete against these players, I asked myself "How the hell do they do it?".

In answering this question, I gained my first experiences with **C++** and **.NET** languages.

_At that time, the only programming achievement I made
was getting the different code snippets I found on the internet,
and barely understood, to work together._

However, the resulting Frankenstein applications worked surprisingly well.
I developed the code that manipulated the game's memory in **C++** and
used **VB.NET** and Windows Forms to create the GUIs to operate it.

Eventually, I came across **C#** and the opportunity to manipulate memory directly with it,
which allowed me to develop applications completely in a single language.

At some point, I also learned about **Lua** and was fascinated by the fact that I could easily incorporate the language into my applications.
This resulted in some tools for automating tasks in games -
I implemented the actual reading and manipulation of the game state in **C#**,
and made sure that I could access these functions within small **Lua** scripts.

At that time, I became aware of SecondLife and was impressed by the fact that you could create your own virtual world.
It didn't take long for me to learn **LSL** 
_(an imperative scripting language developed by Linden Lab for controlling objects in the virtual 3D world Second Life)_
and started messing around with it, as well as making in-game money by creating scripts for others.

This led me to web development - you can display websites within the game,
which was something I really wanted to be able to do. This is also where one of my first larger projects emerged, which is still waiting to be completed. 
Since **LSL** is quite rudimentary and lacks features like OOP, I wanted to develop an IDE & compiler that would allow me to use such features.
I wanted to do this with **PHP** and **JS**.
The IDE should run completely in the browser and be compatible with the in-game web browser.
Since there was no way to create and execute scripts with scripts (something I wanted in order to simply click a button in the IDE to try out a script),
I got distracted by the idea of somehow realizing it and started developing prototypes for an interpreter in **PHP**
that sent HTTP commands to a "runtime" script within the game world and executed in-game functions.

_To be continued ..._
